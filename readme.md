# Case Studies on Git Bash & GitHub in Education 
## Case Study 1: Collaborative Assignment Submission 
A group of students in a computer science class used GitHub Classroom to submit 
assignments. Each student cloned the repository using Git Bash, worked locally, and pushed 
updates to the central repo. The instructor provided inline feedback via pull requests, 
improving productivity and transparency. 

## Case Study 2: Version Control in Capstone Projects 
A college implemented GitHub to manage final year capstone projects. Students used Git 
Bash to commit changes regularly, enabling tracking of progress and avoiding data loss. 
Faculty monitored repository commit logs to measure contribution levels.
